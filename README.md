OwnBox
======

A method of creating your own cloud service where the files will be stored on your own personal storage devices. The purpose of this project is mainly educational and as a proof of concept but there are advantages to saving your own files compared to saving them to a popular service like DropBox or GoogleDrive. By having them in your own house you have more control who can and cannot access them, you have more power over sharing and saving different version of the same file. For the remainder of the project, I will be using a second gen. Raspberry Pi as a server.
